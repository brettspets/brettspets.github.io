				<p>Welcome to Brettâ€™s Pets Sitting Service! We understand that, for some pets, boarding is just not an option.

Our sitters are dedicated to making pets feel comfortable and put your mind at ease. If you would like to schedule an appointment to meet one of our sitters, please fill out and submit the form to the right. Head on over to the <a href="/terms"><strong>Terms of Service</strong></a> page to review our paperwork and rate plans.</p>
